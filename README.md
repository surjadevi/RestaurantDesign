# Resturant Home Page

## Description
In this project, I have created a desktop and mobile version design for a Resturant. 
I have used Figma to design the responsive site. For the common part, I created a component and used in a different part of the page.

Here is the figma link that you can view my design:

## Future work
I am going to convert this figma design into Html and CSS. Which I will post in separate respository.
